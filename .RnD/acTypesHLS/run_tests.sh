# AC Datatypes (HLSLibs ac_types) reusability test suite.
#
# Moved here from HAPI/.RnD/acTypesHLS/ once Reg<T> was retired in favor
# of oneData::Data<T> directly (see HANDOFF.md's "Reg<T> retired"
# section) -- this investigation now depends on OneData as much as HAPI,
# so it lives alongside OneData's own pre-existing .RnD/hls/FINDINGS.md
# (a separate, earlier round proving OneData's own components synthesize
# under Bambu) rather than under HAPI. Neither HAPI nor OneData has an
# existing test-runner/CI convention to plug into -- this is new, scoped
# scaffolding for this investigation only, not a proposal for permanent
# infrastructure in either library.
#
# Requires:
#   BAMBU_APPIMAGE     - path to a bambu AppImage
#                        (https://release.bambuhls.eu/bambu-2024.10.AppImage)
#   AC_TYPES_INCLUDE   - path to a clone's include/ dir
#                        (git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlslibs/ac_types)
#
# Exits non-zero if any check fails or gives an unexpected result.
